    <h1>Div and Span test</h1>
    <br>
    <div>this is a div.</div>
    <div>This is also a div.</div>
    <div>Div is a blocked element, meaning, whenever you use a div, it starts on a new line</div>
    <br>
    <span>Now this is a span.|</span>
    <span>This is also a span.|</span>
    <span>Unlike the div, the span is an in-line element, meaning it does't break line from the previous one.</span>
